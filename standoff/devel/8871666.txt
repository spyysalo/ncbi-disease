Molecular bases of combined subtotal deficiencies of C6 and C7: their effects in combination with other C6 and C7 deficiencies.
Combined subtotal deficiency of C6 and C7, in which both proteins are expressed at very low levels, has been observed in homozygous form in two families. A defect at the 5 splice donor site of intron 15 of the C6 gene explains the low molecular weight of the C6 protein and is probably responsible for its low expressed concentration. The C7 defect is more enigmatic  the protein is of normal molecular weight, low circulating concentration, and altered isoelectric point. An Arg > Ser codon substitution in exon 11 is the only molecular alteration within the mature C7 protein. These defects are associated with a characteristic set of polymorphic DNA markers in the C6/C7 region, forming a distinct haplotype. The haplotype has been found in combination with a number of other haplotypes containing defective genes that lead either to C6 or C7 deficiency, but with different consequences. Where it is combined with a C6-deficient gene, the serum C7 levels can be surprisingly high, possibly because there is no C6 generating C56 to consume the C7. In contrast, where the C7 genes are both defective (but still partially functional), there may be a profound deficit of circulating C7 because there is ample C6 to produce C56 and consume the already small amount of C7. Each molecular defect has also been found in isolation and has the expected effect..
