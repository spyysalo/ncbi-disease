Identification of WASP mutations, mutation hotspots and genotype-phenotype disparities in 24 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked immunodeficiency disease caused by mutation in the recently isolated gene encoding WAS protein (WASP), is known to be associated with extensive clinical heterogeneity. Cumulative mutation data have revealed that WASP genotypes are also highly variable among WAS patients, but the relationship of phenotype with genotype in this disease remains unclear. To address this issue we characterized WASP mutations in 24 unrelated WAS patients, including 18 boys with severe classical WAS and 6 boys expressing mild forms of the disease, and then examined the degree of correlation of these as well as all previously published WASP mutations with disease severity. By analysis of these compiled mutation data, we demonstrated clustering of WASP mutations within the four most N-terminal exons of the gene and also identified several sites within this region as hotspots for WASP mutation. These characteristics were observed, however, in both severe and mild cases of the disease. Similarly, while the cumulative data revealed a predominance of missense mutations among the WASP gene lesions observed in boys with isolated thrombocytopenia, missense mutations were not exclusively associated with milder WAS phenotypes, but also comprised a substantial portion (38%) of the WASP gene defects found in patients with severe disease. These findings, as well as the detection of identical WASP mutations in patients with disparate phenotypes, reveal a lack of phenotype concordance with genotype in WAS and thus imply that phenotypic outcome in this disease cannot be reliably predicted solely on the basis of WASP genotypes..
