Mutations in the arginine-rich protein gene (ARP) in pancreatic cancer.
The ARP gene encodes a highly conserved arginine-rich protein from chromosomal band 3p21. 1 1. At the cytogenetic level this region is frequently deleted in a variety of different solid tumors, although not in pancreatic cancer. We have reported the presence of a specific mutation (ATG50-- > AGG) or deletion of codon 50 of the ARP gene in different tumor types (Shridhar et al., 1996, 1996a). In the present study, we have observed mutations involving codon 50 in 11 of 37 pancreatic tumors. The frequency of codon 50 mutation is roughly the same in pancreatic tumors as in the other types of tumors previously examined. In addition, we have detected mutations at codon 51 in multiple PCR subclones in two other pancreatic tumors. Mutations in the ARP gene are thus commonly observed in pancreatic cancer, as well as many other cancers.
