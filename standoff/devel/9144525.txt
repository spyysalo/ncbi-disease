The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure.
The ninth component of human complement (C9) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex. C9 is a single-chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p. Deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections. We studied a previously described Swiss family with inherited C9 deficiency. To identify the genetic basis of C9 deficiency, we developed an approach using exon-specific PCR and direct DNA sequencing. As a cause of C9 deficiency , we found two different point mutations, both generating TGA stop codons in the coding sequence. One mutation, a C to A exchange, was detected in exon 2 at cDNA position 166, the other, a C to T exchange, was located in exon 4 (cDNA position 464). In family studies of three first-degree relatives with heterozygous C9 deficiency, we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently. Therefore, these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied. DNA sequencing of the exon-intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4, 5, and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11. No additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10. Furthermore, DNA marker studies were conducted using known polymorphisms of the C6, C7, and C9 genes, confirming the linkage of the observed C9 mutations with defined haplotypes..
