Fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations.
Heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor Fas dominantly interfere with Fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome. This effect, rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization, was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain. Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein. These results show that formation of preassociated receptor complexes is necessary for Fas signaling and dominant interference in human disease..
