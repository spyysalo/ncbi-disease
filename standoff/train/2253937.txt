Detection of 98% of DMD/BMD gene deletions by polymerase chain reaction.
We describe oligonucleotide primer sequences that can be used to amplify eight exons plus the muscle promoter of the dystrophin gene in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When used in conjunction with an existing primer set, these two multiplex reactions detect about 98% of deletions in patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD, BMD). Furthermore, these primers amplify most of the exons in the deletion prone " hot spot " region around exons 44 to 53, allowing determination of deletion endpoints and prediction of mutational effects on the translational reading frame. Thus, use of these PCR-based assays will allow deletion detection and prenatal diagnosis for most DMD/BMD patients in a fraction of the time required for Southern blot analysis..
