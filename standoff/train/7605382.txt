Frequency of exon 15 missense mutation (442D:G) in cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene in hyperalphalipoproteinemic Japanese subjects.
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfers cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to apo B-containing lipoproteins. The hyperalphalipoproteinemia caused by CETP deficiency is fairly common in Japan and one of the most common mutations in the CETP gene is the splicing defect of the intron 14, the allelic frequency of which has been shown to be 0. 0049 in the Japanese general population. Recently, we have reported a missense mutation in exon 15 of the CETP gene (442D  G), showing a dominant effect on the CETP activity and HDL-cholesterol level. In the current study, we determined the frequency of this new mutation in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic (HDL-cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dl) subjects. A rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis. Among 117 Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects (HDL-cholesterol; 116. 7 +/- 16. 5 mg/dl, mean +/- S. D.) without the intron 14 splice defect, three homozygotes (2. 5%) and 34 heterozygotes (29. 1%) were found to have the 442D  G mutation. The relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0. 17. One of the homozygotes for the 442D  G mutation was the patient previously described by us as having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart disease. This was the first reported subject homozygous for the CETP deficiency who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms. In homozygous subjects, CETP activity ranged from 37% to 62% of the normal value, which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported; however, the specific activity of CETP was not as low as expected.
