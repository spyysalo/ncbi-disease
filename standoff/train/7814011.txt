Novel mutation at the initiation codon in the Norrie disease gene in two Japanese families.
We have identified a new mutation of Norrie disease (ND) gene in two Japanese males from unrelated families; they showed typical ocular features of ND but no mental retardation or hearing impairment. A mutation was found in both patients at the initiation codon of exon 2 of the ND gene (ATG to GTG), with otherwise normal nucleotide sequences. Their mothers had the normal and mutant types of the gene, which was expected for heterozygotes of the disease. The mutation of the initiation codon would cause the failure of ND gene expression or a defect in translation thereby truncating the amino terminus of ND protein. In view of the rarity and marked heterogeneity of mutations in the ND gene, the present apparently unrelated Japanese families who have lived in the same area for over two centuries presumably share the origin of the mutation..
