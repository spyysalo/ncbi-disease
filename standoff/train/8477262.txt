Identification of mutations in Danish choroideremia families.
We have searched for mutations in the choroideremia gene (CHM) in patients from 12 Danish families in which CHM is segregating. Employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct DNA sequencing, different mutations have been identified in 6 patients. All the mutations will interfere with the correct translation of the mRNA predicting a truncated protein or no gene product at all..
