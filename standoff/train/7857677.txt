Homozygous presence of the crossover (fusion gene) mutation identified in a type II Gaucher disease fetus: is this analogous to the Gaucher knock-out mouse model?
Gaucher disease (GD) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase (EC 3. 1. 2. 45, gene symbol GBA). In type I GD, the CNS is not involved (nonneuronopathic), whereas in type II GD (acute neuronopathic) CNS involvement is early and rapidly progressive, while in type III GD (subacute neuronopathic) CNS involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive. The T6433C (L444P) substitution is prevalent in type GD II. It may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional GBA nucleotide substitutions, G6468C (A456P) and G6482C (V460V), without (recNciI) or with (recTL) G5957C (D409H). This complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination (crossover, fusion) of the structural gene with the pseudogene, which contains the mutated sequences. Two complex alleles have never been demonstrated to coexist in any individual. We devised a selective PCR method for the specific amplification of the normal and/or fusion gene. Using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time, in a Macedonian/Ashkenazi Jewish GD type II fetus. Both parents were carriers of the recombination. This was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. A previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks, with features of severe type II GD. Neonates showing a severe clinical phenotype, analogous to the early neonatal lethal disease occurring in mice homozygous for a null allele produced by targeted disruption of GBA, have been described elsewhere, but the specific mutations in these cases have not yet been characterized.
