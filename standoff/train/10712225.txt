A recurrent expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats causes Huntington disease in two sisters.
Large intergenerational repeat expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the HD gene have been well documented for the male germline. We describe a recurrent large expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats (to 66 and 57 repeats, respectively, in two daughters) associated with onset of Huntington disease (HD) in the second and third decade in a family without history of HD. Our findings give evidence of a gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother. We hypothesize that large expansions also occur in the female germline and that a negative selection of oocytes with long repeats might explain the different instability behavior of the male and the female germlines..
