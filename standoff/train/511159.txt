Incidence and characteristics of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants in Japan.
A total of 3000 men living in Yamaguchi were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using Beutlers spot test and three types of starch gel electrophoresis. These electrophoresis used a phosphate buffer system at pH 7. 0, a TRIS-EDTA-borate buffer system at pH 8. 6, and a TRIS-hydrochloride buffer system at pH 8.. Fifteen G6PD-deficient variants were found at the rate of 0. 5% and classified into four groups. As new variants, G6PD Konan, Kamiube, and Kiwa were identified. These three variants had a mild to moderate G6PD deficiency and were not associated with any clinical signs. G6PD Konan had fast electrophoretic mobility as compared with normal levels, G6PD Kiwa had slightly elevated electrophoretic mobility, and G6PD Kamiube had normal electrophoretic mobility. These three variants had normal levels of Km G6P, Km NADP, and Ki NADPH, normal utilizations of both 2-deoxy-G6P and deamino-NAPD, normal heat stability, and a normal pH curve. The other variant was G6PD Ube, which we had previously found in Yamaguchi (Nakashima et al., 1977). One boy with G6PD Ube was Korean
