Carrier detection of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency in fibroblasts and lymphocytes.
Pyruvate carboxylase (E. C. 6. 4. 1. 1) activity was determined in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from the family of a patient with hepatic, cerebral, renal cortical, leukocyte, and fibroblast pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PC Portland deficiency). Lymphocyte activities were  mother, 33--39%; father, 11--29%; brother, 82--103%; and sister, 38--48% of the lowest normal. Fibroblasts from the patients mother and father had 42 and 34%, respectively, of the activity of the lowest normal. These data demonstrate that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and that lymphocytes and fibroblasts can be used to detect carriers. Neither pyruvate carboxylase nor mitochondrial PEPCK activity in lymphocytes was increased by a 21-hr fast.
