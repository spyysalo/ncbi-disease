Serum amyloid A and P protein genes in familial Mediterranean fever.
Two recent studies have suggested the involvement of serum amyloid A (SAA) and P (APCS) genes in familial Mediterranean fever (MEF). To test the role of SAA and APCS in MEF and MEF-amyloidosis, we studied 17 informative families (15 Armenians, 2 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 8 MEF patients with amyloidosis using a candidate gene approach. No evidence for any MEF-associated polymorphism was found in any of the 41 Armenian and Jewish MEF patients tested. Our family studies allowed us to rule out tight linkage between SAA and MEF (lod score = -2. 16, theta less than or equal to 0. 06). For APCS we found that the allele frequency in the MEF-amyloidosis patients was similar to that in 18 unrelated MEF patients without amyloidosis and their 33 healthy parents.
