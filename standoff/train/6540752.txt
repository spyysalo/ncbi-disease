Genetic polymorphism of G6PD in a Bulgarian population.
Considerable genetic heterogeneity in G6PD was found in the Bulgarian population-14 G6PD variants isolated from 117 hemizygous carriers of G6PD deficiency. Of these, G6PD Mediterranean type was a polymorphic variant and G6PD Corinth occurred with high frequency. Two new variants were identified-G6PD Rudosem and G6PD Nedelino. In a selected group of 78 subjects with clinical manifestations, four variants were established  G6PD Mediterranian, G6PD Corinth, G6PD Seattle and G6PD Ohut II..
