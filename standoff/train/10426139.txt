A novel frameshift mutation in the McLeod syndrome gene in a Japanese family.
We report a novel mutation in the XK gene (XK) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome. A 50-year-old man showed progressive muscular atrophy, choreic movement, elevated level of serum creatinine kinase, and acanthocytosis. The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (T) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK. This deletion caused a frameshift in translation, leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408. We conclude this single-base deletion causes defective Kx protein, which is responsible for the McLeod phenotype in this patient..
