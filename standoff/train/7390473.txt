Variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in Bulgarian populations.
Ten variants of erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in 22 patients with G6PD deficiency from three districts of Bulgaria. Corinth-like and Fayoum-like variants were the most frequent; Mediterranean, Ohut II, Kilgore, Boston, Poznan, and Panay variants and two new variants, Petrich and Gotze Delchev, were each found in one or two carriers. No correlation was revealed between clinical and biochemical polymorphism..
