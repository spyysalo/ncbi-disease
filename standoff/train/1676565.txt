Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease using a combination of anonymous DNA polymorphisms and the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene cDNA.
We report carrier identification and a prenatal diagnosis using DNA polymorphisms in 2 families with X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). In both families, the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene in the single affected male could be traced back to his unaffected maternal grandfather. Therefore, each family contains a new mutation. In the case of the prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was shown by cytogenetic analysis to be a female, who we predict will be a noncarrier of PMD based on her genotype with the PLP intragenic polymorphism..
