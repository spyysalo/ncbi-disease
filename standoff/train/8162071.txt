Mutations at the PAX6 locus are found in heterogeneous anterior segment malformations including Peters' anomaly.
Mutation or deletion of the PAX6 gene underlies many cases of aniridia. Three lines of evidence now converge to implicate PAX6 more widely in anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. First, a child with Peters anomaly is deleted for one copy of PAX6. Second, affected members of a family with dominantly inherited anterior segment malformations, including Peters anomaly are heterozygous for an R26G mutation in the PAX6 paired box. Third, a proportion of Sey/+ Smalleye mice, heterozygous for a nonsense mutation in murine Pax-6, have an ocular phenotype resembling Peters anomaly. We therefore propose that a variety of anterior segment anomalies may be associated with PAX6 mutations..
