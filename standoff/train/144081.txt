[Genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency: mutant alleles of G6PD in the Shekii district of Azerbaijan]
Examination on G6PD deficiency in 349 patients of Shekii district hospital (Azerbaijan) revealed 16 hemi-, 4 homo- and 9 heterozygotic carriers of the defect. Gd- frequency, calculated from the data obtained (7. 7%), may be compared to neighbouring regions frequencies (6-30%). Carriers of G6PD deficiency are residents of 11 villages located in Alasani-Aphtalan valley, highly endemic with malaria in the past; nearly all marriages are endogamic. Physico-chemical and kinetic study of 10 mutant forms of G6PD, according to WHO program, led to identification of 5 variants of the II class (Shekii, Bideiz, Shirin-Bulakh, Okhut I and Zakataly) and 2 variants of the III class (Okhut II and Martinique-like). Resemblance of the majority of variants in electrophoretic mobility and the level of erythrocyte enzyme activity permit to suggest the existence of a common parental mutant G6PD allele distributed in this area.
