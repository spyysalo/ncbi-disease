The APC gene, responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis, is mutated in human gastric cancer.
Although gastric cancer is the most common cancer in the world, genetic changes during its carcinogenesis are not well understood. Since some gastric cancers are considered to originate from the intestinal metaplasia, it is likely that the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, the mutation of which causes adenomatous polyps in the colon, is associated with carcinogenesis of gastric cancer. Based on this idea, DNAs isolated from gastric cancers were examined by means of a RNase protection analysis coupled with polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. By screening nearly one-half of the coding region of the APC gene in 44 tumors, somatic mutations were detected in three tumors  a missense mutation, a nonsense mutation, and a 5-base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift which causes truncation of the gene product. These results suggest that the mutation of the APC gene also plays an important role during the carcinogenesis of at least some gastric cancers..
