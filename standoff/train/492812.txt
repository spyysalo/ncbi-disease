Recurrent meningococcal meningitis with absence of the sixth component of complement: an evaluation of underlying immunologic mechanisms.
A 51/2-year-old black girl with recurrent meningococcal meningitis and absence of the sixth component of complement (C6) is reported. To explore the pathogenesis of recurrent neisserial infections in C6 deficiency, a detailed analysis of her immune competence was conducted. Her serum had normal chemotactic, opsonic, alternative complement pathway, and specific antibody activity, but lacked complement-mediated bacteriolytic activity. In addition, her C6-deficient serum was indistinguishable from normal serum in a complement-dependent assay of phagocyte bactericidal activity. Absent bacteriolysis remains the only consistent defect associated with recurrent neisserial infections and absence of one of the late-acting complement components..
