Exclusion of linkage between familial Mediterranean fever and the human serum amyloid A (SAA) gene cluster.
We studied the relationship between the autosomal recessive trait familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and the serum amyloid A (SAA) genes by comparing alleles of a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat and a conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the SAA gene cluster in Israeli FMF kindreds. By haplotype analysis, our data indicate a minimum crossover frequency of 22% between the SAA gene marker and FMF. By conventional linkage analysis this eliminates a minimum of 10. 4 cM including and surrounding the SAA gene cluster as the site of the FMF mutation although SAA proteins are prominent physiologic markers of the acute attacks.
